# APItester

APItester does just that.  A list of API endpoints and their associated query parameters and parsable return values are defined in csv (I use Excel to manage the csv).  This list is executed in the order and repetition specified.  The resulting execution times are captured to the DB for analysis.

The order of execution is important, the parsable return values can be used is subsequent calls.
